Normalization:
it is a technique to reduce or remove redendancy from a table
there are two types of redendancy row level and colume level 

1st normal Form:
1st normalization said that one colume must have only Single value. (Atomic values)
Example you should not save email and customer address in the same colume

2nd Normal Form:
The table should be in the first normal form and all coloumes dependes on table primary key

Example if we have 4 columes like customer, customer address, product,Productmanufacturer
so we make two table one for customer and other one is for product 

3rd noraml form:
the table is in second noraml for and all of its colume are non transitivly depnedend 
on the primary key
